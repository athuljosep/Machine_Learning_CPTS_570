## Overview
This project involves generating results for various questions using defined functions and a structured script. The required packages and instructions to run the code are listed below.

## Required Packages
Ensure you have the following Python packages installed before running the code:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `csv`
- `datetime`
- `fashion_mnist`

You can install the packages using the following command:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib fashion-mnist
```

## Instructions to Run

1. **Run the main script:**
   To generate all the results, execute the `main_code.py` file. This script will compute the answers to all questions by calling the appropriate functions defined within the script.
   
   Run the following command:
   ```bash
   python main_code.py
   ```

2. **Code Structure:**
   - All necessary functions are defined at the beginning of the script.
   - Towards the end of the script, the code for each question is structured. These sections call the relevant functions and output the required results.

## Notes
- Ensure that the required datasets (if any) are available in the correct directories before running the code.
- The results will be displayed via terminal or saved as outputs in the specified location, depending on the question.
